# LearningPyTorch
Repository exploring PyTorch and creating some models

- Series of notebooks going through PyTorch and learning how to implement the different models available
- Nn_classification_linear: notebook going over the linear classification model created using nn.Model and Sequential
- Nn_classification_multiclass: notebook going over the multiclass classification model created using nn.Linear feeding into other nn.Linear layers and implementing optimizer and loss functions
- Vision: creating a model to conduct image classification using the different FashionMNISTModel from V0-V2
- Workflow: Notebook going over general best practices for using PyTorch to create different models, testing them, and saving them to be used in other projects
- Helper_functions: functions used across multiple notebooks such as plotting model predictions, saving and downloading models etc.
